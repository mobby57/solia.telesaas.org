# Solia Backend Test Plan

## 1. Modular Functional Testing

### Auth Module
- Test login, refresh, logout flows
- Test auth middleware with valid, invalid, expired tokens
- Test role-based access control and scopes

### User Module
- Test user profile retrieval and update
- Test user creation by admin
- Test userRole assignments and validations

### Role / UserRole Module
- Test role creation, update, deletion
- Test userRole relations and permission checks

### ApiKey Module
- Test API key creation with scopes
- Test API key validation, expiration, and revocation
- Test API key usage in protected endpoints

### Mission Module
- Test CRUD operations with tenantId filtering
- Test assignment and filtering by user and tenant
- Test authorization for mission operations

### Comment Module
- Test adding and deleting comments linked to missions and users

### Billing Module
- Test Stripe integration and webhook handling (mocked)

## 2. Technical Setup

- Use Vitest + Supertest for tests
- Use MongoMemoryServer for isolated DB tests
- Mock JWT, bcrypt, Stripe, Date, UUID as needed
- Track coverage with `vitest --coverage`

## 3. Authentication & Security Tests

- Valid and invalid login attempts
- Token refresh and expiration handling
- Middleware protection with token validation
- Scope and role enforcement tests

## 4. API REST Tests (per module)

- Test all endpoints with happy and error paths
- Test multi-tenant data isolation
- Test edge cases and invalid inputs

## 5. Unit Tests

- Test services, helpers, and validations
- Aim for >95% coverage on critical modules

## 6. Integration Tests

- Test multi-tenant data separation
- Test superAdmin multi-tenant scenarios

## 7. Load & Stress Tests (optional)

- Use Artillery or k6 to simulate high load
- Test brute force, flood, and race conditions

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline

- Linting, formatting checks
- Run unit and integration tests with coverage
- Build Docker images
- Vulnerability scanning

## 9. Reporting

- Generate HTML coverage reports
- Export Postman collections or snapshots
- Compare Swagger docs with tested endpoints

Please confirm if you want me to proceed with writing concrete test cases for these modules or start setting up the CI/CD pipeline.
