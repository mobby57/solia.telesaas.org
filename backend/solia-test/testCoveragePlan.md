# Test Coverage Plan for Solia Backend

## Overview
This plan outlines the critical and thorough testing strategy for the Solia backend, focusing on authentication, authorization, and key modules.

---

## Modules and Endpoints to Cover

### 1. Authentication (authJwt middleware)
- Verify token validation and error handling
- Role-based access control enforcement
- Token expiration and invalid token scenarios

### 2. User Module
- Endpoints: GET /user, GET /user/:id, POST /user, PUT /user/:id, DELETE /user/:id
- Access control via verifyToken and tenantMiddleware
- Test CRUD operations with valid and invalid data
- Test access with and without valid tokens

### 3. Role Module
- Endpoints: GET /role, GET /role/:id, POST /role, PUT /role/:id, DELETE /role/:id
- Access control via authMiddleware and tenantMiddleware
- Test CRUD operations and access control

### 4. APIKey Module
- Endpoints: POST /apiKey, GET /apiKey, GET /apiKey/:id, PATCH /apiKey/:id/revoke, DELETE /apiKey/:id
- Access control via authJwt(['admin'])
- Test creation, listing, revocation, deletion, and access control
- Test requireScope middleware for scope-based access control

## Testing Levels

### Critical-path Testing
- Test key endpoints for authentication and authorization
- Verify token validation and role enforcement
- Basic CRUD operations on User, Role, APIKey modules

### Thorough Testing
- Full coverage of all endpoints and edge cases
- Test error scenarios: invalid tokens, expired tokens, missing roles
- Test tenant isolation and multi-tenant scenarios
- Test scope-based access control in APIKey module
- Performance and load testing (optional)

## Testing Tools and Setup
- Use Vitest or Jest for unit and integration tests
- Use Supertest for HTTP request simulation
- Mock external dependencies as needed
- Use test database or in-memory DB for isolation

---

## Next Steps
- Implement automated tests based on this plan
- Review and update tests regularly
- Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
